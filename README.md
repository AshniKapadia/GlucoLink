# GlucoLink
Revolutionizing diabetes care by advancing glucose monitoring software and delivering real-time critical alerts to empower global healthcare.

Born Out Of Necessity:
Glucolink was created to address a critical gap in diabetes care—making sure patients receive help when their blood glucose levels reach dangerous levels. Existing glucose monitoring systems rely heavily on patients to manage their data and recognize emergencies on their own. We set out to change this by building a system that turns continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data into real-time alerts for Emergency Medical Services (EMS). By automating the process, Glucolink ensures patients are supported when they need it most, without having to shoulder the responsibility alone.

The project began with a clear mission: to create a tool that doesn’t just monitor glucose levels but actively helps save lives. We started by defining thresholds for when alerts should trigger and tested them thoroughly to ensure accuracy. From there, we developed a platform that connects CGM devices to EMS networks, using secure data processing and real-time communication tools. After multiple iterations and refinements, Glucolink emerged as a reliable system that reduces the burden on patients, speeds up emergency responses, and improves care for people managing diabetes.
